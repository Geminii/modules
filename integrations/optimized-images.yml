  - Can resize images or generate low-quality image placeholders (lqip) and extract the dominant colors of it.
  - Provides query params for file-specific handling/settings.
  - Content hash to the file name so images can get cached on CDN level and in the browser for a long time.
  - Inlined small images to save HTTP requests and additional roundtrips.
  - Same URLs for unchanged images over multiple builds for long time caching.
